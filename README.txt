Include a README.txt file to justify why your project is worth 100 points.  
For example: What was hard? Did you use any cool JavaScript libraries? 
What nifty features of your program were a bear to implement? What did you learn?

Our project is worth 100 points for a few reasons. The first is that we made the computer 
AI player smart. Instead of just playing a random card that fit with the rules we made it 
pick the best card based on what the human player had selected. 

The hardest part of the game was the handling of the cards. This proved challenging at first as we
did not know what data structurevto use to hold the deck of cards. Once that was figured out a 
random shuffle and deal function were created to shuffle and deal the cards at the beginning of the game
as well as after a players hand no longer had any cards. After we got the deal and hands working displaying
the cards was the next challenge. We display them in a drop down menu. It took a little bit to figure out
how to get the hand displayed, but the real challenge was ensuring that the dropdown menu gets updated
everytime a card is played as well as ensuring the human player doesn't play a spades if spades has not yet
been played. After we got that figured out the last challenge with the cards was dealing and displaying
the cards after the first hand was done. This was challenging because it involved reseting a lot of different
variables as well as html objects. When had got it working on the backend relatively quickly, but the display
side was still causing issues. What we learned was that when changing the style of a div to none just reassigning
text to that div will not make it appear, and the style needs to be changed back to whatever it previously was

A cool thing that we learned was how to work remotely together. As it is finals week and everyone is busy
wrapping up their classes we did not have overlapping free time that allwed for us to work on it together.
To still get everything done in time we made sure to respond promptly to texts when someone had a question
as well as letting each team member know when a task was completed. 

One thing we would like to add to the game if given more time is to further improve that AI and allow
the AI to start the game.
